                                <p>Max Altitude :- 11,100 Ft.</p>
                                <p>Approx Trekking Km :- 62 Kms.</p>
                                <p>The journey starts at the mountain town of Leh. The only way to reach Leh is by flight and it is surrounded by snow giving it a complete white look. 
                                   One can catch a glimpse of the snow capped mountains from the flight as it descends toward Leh which is located at 11400 feet above sea level. 
                                   The trek is over the Zanskar River which lies frozen during the winter. The most preferred time to cross the ice would be in February. 
                                   During that time, the ice tends to be at its most stable state. The Frozen River Trek begins from the small village of Chilling from where the Zanskar River begins to freeze.

                                  <h3>Across the Ice</h3>
                                <p>The ice can be as dangerous at times as it can be safe during others. One needs to figure out the safe paths over the precarious sheet and must always be aware of the ice conditions below the feet. 
                                    The trekkers can choose to camp in the caves along the banks like the locals or set up tents where the ice is the most stable. The setting is close to twenty degrees below freezing point and decreases further after sundown as well. 
                                    Warm and layered clothes are recommended as is being on the move as much as possible. These help invariably in keeping the body warm and prevent cold sores and also keep the blood from freezing.
                                <h3>Better Safe than Sorry</h3>
                                <p>
                                    It is always recommended to be aware of the ice conditions at all times. There are several factors to consider ensuring a safe journey. Most of these factors involve the conditions of the ice and the footing choices of the trekker. 
                                    The precautions include:
                                    <ul>

                                 <h3>Gear and Trekking Info</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Trekking gear should be brought from home as there are not many places available at Leh during the winter where supplies can be bought. Food that can be preserved and made quickly such as instant noodles is an excellent addition. 
                                    One should always have enough before starting off as it is recommended to be moving for the better part of the day in order to keep warm as well as keeping the journey in momentum. Ice picks, trekking boots, several layers of extra 
                                    warm clothing are a compulsion in such conditions. Tents are recommended but optional as one can easily camp in caves like the locals who journey across the river. However, being a non-local, that idea may not be advisable and carrying 
                                    tents is always commendable.

                                            After walking for a couple of hours you'll come across different rock patterns along the way which look art looks when the sun rays fall on them making their way from behind the clouds. You will be camping near the Tibb cave which is surrounded by dry sand.

                                    <h3>Day 6: Tibb Cave to Nerak</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        As you move on to the most awaited campsite of the trek which is Nerak, the 13km long trail will take you to the most iconic landmark of the Chadar trek. i.e. The frozen waterfall. 
                                        The frozen waterfall is a nature's masterpiece that attracts trekkers around the world. Hot lunch will be served on your way to Nerak.
                                    <p>
                                        By far, Nerak will be the coldest of all the campsites on the trek where the temperature goes down to as low as -30 degrees during the night. It will be important that you wear proper clothing in layers to stay safe from the biting cold. 
                                        If you manage to reach the waterfall on time, there are chances of paying a visit to the Nerak Village as well. You will be camping at a distance of 15-20 minutes from the waterfall.
                                    </p>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You might have heard stories of how unpredictable the weather patterns can get here on the Chadar trek. There are instances where the formation of Chadar no longer exists on your way back from Nerak. 
                                        In the same way, you will witness a new layer of Chadar formed at some. Even though it's the same route, you'll be amazed to see how different it appears while coming back. Chadar Trek is an experience of a lifetime that every trekking enthusiast should witness. 
                                        And then, what if we told you that these eight days of your life are going to be some of the best days you've lived so far and that you'll cherish these moments till the very end. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Today retrace your steps back to Tibb Cave. You get another last chance to cherish, relive and gather the memories. 
                                        Wave goodbye to all the locals while you make your way back. Be careful and enjoy your last stay in tents.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 8: Tibb Cave to Shingra Koma then Drive to Leh (70km)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Again wake up early for a long walk back. It is not really retracing steps because you may observe a lot have changed. Chadar may have melted, layer of Chadar may have gotten thin, wonderful rocks are visible now. 
                                        Wea ll, that's the beauty of nature and Chadar trek. Reach Shingra Koma and get ready to board on vehicles. Another bumpy ride and you will arrive in Leh.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>How to Reach</h4>
                                    <h3>By Air :-</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Flying over miles and miles of heavily snowed mountains will tell you just why it’s impossible to reach Ladakh by road in the winters. Jet Airways, Air India and Go Air provide daily (once every day) flight service between New Delhi and Leh. 
                                        However if you plan a trip to this area of the country, you must try to book your tickets well in advance. This might even cut down the prices which may be levied on booking at the last time. You would enjoy the flight as you would fly over many untouched areas and even some mountain ranges. 
                                        The aerial view is just fascinating and gives a great start to your tour.
