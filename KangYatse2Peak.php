                                    <h3> Day 01- Arrival Leh</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Kang Yatse II Peak Expedition begins from Leh. Arrive in Leh through flight or train. Your stay will be in the hotel after you reach. 
                                        Leh is already at a height of 11,000 ft, hence you should be acclimatized pretty well. 
                                        Use this day as an opportunity to rest and get your body acclimatized to the high altitudes. 
                                        <p>
                                            Good phone connectivity is available in Leh. You can use this day to shop for the forgotten things or rent equipment. 
                                            Strictly stay from alcohol and smoking. If you arrive late, you can rest for the day. You can additionally roam around and get adapted to the culture. 
                                            Leh is quite popular for its cultural treasures, monasteries, palaces and temples. Try to keep it low and easy on the body.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As per the J&K government, foreigners(including OCI, NRI) need to obtain a special permit to trek in J&K. This permit is issued in Srinagar and therefore, 
                                            foreigners need to come one day before in Leh. This process requires your signed ILP, therefore it cannot be processed in advance and can be processed only 
                                            when you enter J&K. The charges of obtaining the permit will be Rs.2, 000 per person. TAH will cooperate with you in getting the permit. You have to pay this 
                                            amount to our representative and we shall get the permit, once you have arrived. Please make a note that your expenses for the additional day are not included in 
                                            our costs.

                                            Citizens of China, Myanmar, and Bangladesh are not permitted to trek in J&K.

                                    <h3> Day 02- Acclimatisation at Leh</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Yet another day to get used to the low temperatures or to discover the splendid Leh! Apart from adventures and surreal scenery, Leh is well-known for its monasteries and palaces. 
                                        Step into the history of Leh through the Shey Palace, Thiksey Monastery and ThikseyGompa. You can find thousands of adventure seekers or tourists in Leh during peak season. 
                                        Try to interact with everyone to get used to the culture. Leh is famous for its cafes and hanging out places. If you wish you can try them. Again, strictly keep hands off alcohol and smoking.
                                        <p>
                                            Apart from cultural heritage, Leh must be travelled for its passes and lakes like Nubra valley, Pangonglake. We do not allow roaming of trekkers to such places. 
                                            This is to avoid strain on the body that might hurdle the process of acclimatization. Therefore, try to avoid moving to higher altitudes and stroll to nearby places. 
                                            Enjoy your wonderful stay in the hotel. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It can be quite an exhausting day so it better to sleep early listening to the gushing waters of Perk River.
                                        </p>
                                    </p>
