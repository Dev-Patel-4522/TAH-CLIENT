                                    an altitude of 6400 feet and takes about 10 hours to reach. It’s a distance of 220 km from Dehradun. The trekking trip starts from Sankri

                                    fascinating Himalayas make it up for all the hard work with its breathtaking views. On conquering the peak it’s a journey back where the 
                                    first stop would be at Horegaon camp at 8900 feet which can be reached on the same day evening. The next day it’s a trail back to Sankri 
                                    through dense pine forests. From Sankri it’s a journey back to Dehradun and way forward.

                                        forest trees and thick carpet of maple and pine leaves all brown in color. It’s an exquisite vision and a pictorial view that leaves 
                                        all mesmerized. The trail is wide and one can hear the sounds of running streams all through but may not be in view till much further. 
                                        On the way one can view remote villages where women and kids are found carrying bundles of wooden logs, wooden sticks and dry leaves 
                                        to utilize them for household cooking and setting up night fire. While crunching the dried maple and oak leaves on the way up one can 
                                        also view Himalayan Languars swinging from one branch of trees to another. Though they are somewhat a shy animal it’s difficult to 
                                        have a gallant view of them as they move quickly from the vision’s range. Apart from this, boars, martens and hares can also be spotted 
                                        in this region. The scenario however changes a lot in the summer months when the luscious meadows remain verdant green with hilly flowers 
                                        of unique kind. Crossing few streams and continuing through the trail and rising sharp through dense oaks one can reach the beautiful 
                                        pictorial spot of Jadu Ka Talab which can never be missed by any trekker due to its sharp contrasting and unique beauty.
                                        <p>
                                            Jadu Ka talab is a too perfect a destination. The sharp contrast of a giant lake on the left and thick pine and oak forest on the

                                    <h3>Day 6: Departure day (Sankri to Dehradun)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The last day of the trip is the departure day where the trekkers need to travel back to Dehradun. Tata Sumo or a similar make car will 
                                        be provided for a travel back of 220 kms to the city. Start the day early by enjoying the morning sun once again from Sankri and then 
                                        enjoy a healthy and relishing breakfast at the hotel. Pack the bags and take all the belongings and check out of the hotel by 8 am 
                                        approximately so that the journey to Dehradun can be started early. The distance takes about 10 hours to reach excluding the break 
                                        times so the earlier one starts its always the better. The return will again be through NH123, though there are other routes available 
                                        too through Mori Sankari Road or through NH72. However it’s better to take the initial NH123 route only as it is the shortest and have 
                                        much less traffic. Scenic ambience and lovely surroundings mark the roads back to Dehradun city. Cherish the picturesque beauty of the 
                                        location, the avid beauty of nature, the stretched landscapes, the verdant meadows and splendid ambience that pleases the heart in every 
                                        way.
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The best part of the trip, is that the trip is well balanced and smartly packaged so that travellers get ample rest and relaxation 
                                            and enjoy the beauty at every stop without hurrying at any place. It is a trip well designed to take care of the comfort and facilities 
                                            of the travellers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The trip back to Dehradun reaches around 7 o clock evening time. The vacationers can be off boarded either at the railway station or 
                                            at the airport as per their requirement. From here they can plan the next journey by booking a travel well after 8 pm. For all those who wish to stay in Dehradun and enjoy the place for a day or more can book a hotel in the city and spend some more lovely days in midst the beautiful Himalayas.

                                        Take the overnight train to Dehradun from Delhi

                                        Nandadevi Express - Train no: 12205 (Departure 11:50pm; Arrival - 5:40am)

                                        There is regular bus service from Delhi to Dehradun, from Delhis ISBT Kashmere Gate.

                                        We would suggest you to take only government buses from ISBT Kashmere Gate. Private buses ply from outside ISBT and they are 
                                        not trust worthiness.
