                                <h4>About the trek</h4>
                                <p>The Everest Base Camp Trek, is one of the most famous Trek in Nepal, which is famous for its fantastic mountain peaks and the beauty on the hills. Most of the places to this spot go through ridges and trails, but you would have ample space to rest and have meal on your way. 
                                    And one of the best things about this place is that you don’t have to worry about being lost, as you can ask anybody for the next village. The people here are very friendly and offer help and support even to strangers. The people who live here are mostly shepherds and understand English; some even speak it fluently.
                                </p>

                                <p>You can come to this destination all around the year as people trek in all seasons; however the best time to come to this area is between March to mid may and between Septembers to mid November. 
                                    Many people do not prefer coming here in winters as the weather is very cold and the snow all around may make your trekking experience difficult. In such conditions, it would not be possible to go to higher altitudes. 
                                    At higher altitudes, the lodges may even be closed due to the weather and you might have a difficult time in finding a place to rest and spend the night. Therefore it becomes a mandate to carry your tents along. 
                                    Not to mention, the nights may get very cold and you would have to carry some extra clothes to keep you warm.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    During the summers, the season is wet and the peaks are lost in the clouds. Therefore April and May might just prove a good time to go around this place. You can enjoy the tree and shrubs blossoming in this season, with Rhododendrons in particular. This adds a spectacular colour and beauty to the surrounding. 
                                    However the views are much better if you plan a post monsoon trek than a pre monsoon trek because the rain and wind clear the dust which blows from the terrain. However while trekking to this area; it is mandatory to visit the Trekker's Information Management System (TIMS), particularly if you are going to Khumbu region.
                                </p>

                                            The walk from Lukla to Phakding is gradual and has few ups and downs on the way.

                                    <p>
                                        Here, you can see some interesting water mills which are used for grinding corns and barley. It is one of the major staple diet of the Sherpas. Monjo is situated below the magnificent peak of Thermasharkhu. Close to this you have the entrance to the Sagarmatha national park.

                                        This day is reserved for acclimatization and going around the place. Namche Bazaar is a good place to shop and see magnificent views of the area. You would cherish the view of Kwangde peak and its sister peaks in the east.
                                        The houses in Namche Bazaar when looked from a distance appear to be in a U shaped bowl. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You can have a short up- hill walk towards the Sangmatha National Park headquarter. This spot is on the top of Namache Bazaar with breath-taking view of the surrounding areas. You would have a look at the giant snow- covered peaks and mountains. 
                                        There is also a local museum which gives you a fair detail of the history of Himalayas, its geographic and cultural aspects, mountaineering history and various other information on the flora and fauna of the area. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The overnight stay would be in guest houses. You would be highly acclimatized to the area by this time. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 5: Namche Bazaar to Tengboche </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The first half of the walk is fairly simple and easy. You can reach the top of Namche Bazaar after a walk of 20 minutes. After a pleasant walk of 2 hours, you come to a small place at Shanasa. Here you can see the colorful Danphe pheasant, which is the national bird of Nepal and might also get a chance to have a look at the musk-deer and also the Himalayan Thar, 
                                        which is a mountain goat that looks like an antelope. With a gradual descent, you would reach the Imjatse River at Phungitenga which is at a height of 3250 meters. After a strenuous walk from here for an hour, you would reach the religious Buddhist entrance which lies just before Tengboche.
                                        <p>
                                            Here, your walk is over for the day after 5 hours and you can admire and enjoy this religious place. The overnight stay is in guest houses.
                                        </p>
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 6: Tengboche to Dingboche</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        After you have relaxed for the day, you begin the trek towards Dingboche. The path goes through a forest that has trees like birch, juniper, fir, rhododendron etc. Through this forest you arrive to a lovely place i.e. Deboche which is at 3,650 meters. This place gives you a magnificent view of Mt. Ama Dblam, Mt. Everest, Nuptse and Lhotse. 
                                        From here, the walk is mostly up-hill and continues to be so until you reach a large mani- wall gate. From here the way to Dingboche is divided into two paths. One of the paths towards Dingboche also goes through Pangboche. You can take this route to see more views and natural beauty. 
                                    <p>
                                        Dingboche is a lovely place and you will find stone- walls protecting the agricultural fields. The walls are built to protect the crops from cold winds and grazing animals. Your over night stay would again be n guest houses. 
                                    </p>
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 07: Dingboche. </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Dingboche is a lovely and green place. The greenery is spread all around the village and you would find farms and crop- fields all around. The natives here grow crops like barley, buckwheat and potatoes. 
                                        Dingboche has more than tea- houses so you would also like to have a cup of the same. This day is reserved for acclimatization to the weather and place.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You can go for a short walk around the village or might trek to Chukung, which is 3 or 5 hours trek and at a height of 4,730 meters. Chukung is towards the east and lies within the Imjatse valley. Thought the trek is gradual, you would still feel the thin air developing around this place. At Chukung, 
                                        again there are about five tae-houses and give a superb and over- looking view. You can also explore the valley in the surrounding area and later return to your guest house. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 8: Dingboche to Lobuche </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        From Dingboche the trail diverts towards the north, and the path is gradual and easy for the first 40 – 50 minutes. After this easy walk you would come to a mani- prayer stupa. From here the trail s slightly down towards Pheriche village. 
                                        On this day of your walking, you would have a beautiful view of the Mt. Tawache, Ama Dablam, and Pokalde, which is approximately 5,741 meters towards the north. You would also have a view of the great wall of Nuptse. 
                                    <p>
                                        You would have a pleasant walk for the next one and a half to two hours from Pheriche till you reach the small wooded bridge over the river of Khumbu glacier. This place is called Thugla and is the only place which has tea- houses before Lobuche. 
                                        From here another 3 hours of strenuous trekking time brings you to Lobuche which lies at one corner of the hill. The overnight stay would be in guest houses. 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 9: Lobuche to Gorakshep to EBC and back to Gorakshep </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Today will be an exciting day for you as you are very close to your final destination. Today you will have an adventurous journey and a great trekking experience. The first walk of an hour is gradual up to the valley and leads to a grassy field. 
                                        A walk of nearly 20 minutes takes you to the rocky moraine dunes. As you go ahead on your journey you can see the icy- glacial ponds and icebergs which lie below the Khumbu glacier. After a few more rocky moraine dunes and a gradual downhill walk, you reach Gorakshep.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After this, the trek to EBC can be misleading among the high- altitude trekking which is a strenuous climb. You must follow the lead Sherpa as the paths change every season due to the movement of the glaciers. But once you reach to EBC after a total of 7 hours walk, a grand view of the Khumbu ice fall awaits you. EBC is a lively place during the high expedition season.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 10: Hike upto Kalapatthar and retreat trek to Pheriche. </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        After you have trekked to the EBC and returned back to Gorakshep and an over night stay in Guest houses, you are now prepared to climb up to Kalapatthar. Besides, Gorakshep also is a good place to go around. It has a couple of tea- houses and it also used to be the base camp for trekking the Everest in the 1950’s. 
                                        The walk towards Kalapather from Gorakshep starts with a few minutes of easy walk. All this while, you will be walking in the sandy fields. After here, there is a steep climb for about 45 minutes. Post this tiresome and strenuous mountaineering, you would come to the level fields and the walk from here is easy ad gradual. 
                                        You would have the comfort of walking for the next one hour, post which there is again a steep trek to the top of Kalapatthar for about half an hour. The Everest from this point looks closer than you will imagine.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        AAfter here, you trek back to Pheriche. 
                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 11: Pheriche to Namche bazaar. </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        After you have already reached your final destination the previous day, your cumbersome trekking time is almost over. You have done the Everest base camp trek and a lot of Himalayan treks. From this day onwards, you would have pleasant and easy walks throughout. You will be heading downwards to lower elevations. The walk is similar all the while to Thugla. 
                                        After you reach the ridge, you would follow the stream and start traveling towards Pheriche valley. After a walk of around 40 minutes you reach the valley floor. You can take another one hour of easy and simple walk to reach Pheriche which is at 4,243 meters. You would have a wonderful the treks in Nepal by now. You trek down the slope to reach Namche bazaar. 
                                        Once you reach here, the walk for the day is over and you would spend the night in guest houses and enjoy the local meals. 
                                   
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Day 12: Namche Bazar to Phakding to Lukla </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Once you wake up to the lovely weather in Namche Bazaar, you would like to visit the place and go around a little bit, before you start your downhill journey. You can visit the local markets of Namche Bazaar and have a look at the local art crafts and handicrafts. You can buy a lot of stuff from here to make your journey memorable. 
                                        You would like to have a small walk in and around the Sagarmatha National Park. It is a good place for photography and collecting memories. You would also enjoy the local food which has a distinct taste. 
                                    <p>
                                        The trek from Namche Bazaar to Phakding is again a simple and easy walk. You would be trekking down the slope most of the time. The beauty of the forest and distant mountains with several water- falls add to your journey a great delight. This is the beauty of Nepal trekking. 
                                        <b>There will be a few uphill climbs but you will manage it very easily. The lush green beauty and forests will take your pain away. After this easy walk you would reach Lukla. This will be your last day with the Sherpas and other crew members, so you would like to enjoy the day with a delicious dinner and a few drinks.</b>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        On this day you would have to wake up early as the flights to Kathmandu are generally scheduled in the morning. This is because during daytime, the weather is generally windy and there might be a delay in the flight timings. However you expect a slight delay in you r early morning flight as well if the weather is not suitable. 
                                        As you make your way through the security checks and your flight takes off from Lukla airport, you would have a magnanimous view of the surrounding.
